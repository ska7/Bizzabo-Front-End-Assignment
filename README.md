## Description

This is a React app that allows users to search GitHub repositories by name via the GitHub API. All returned results contain their repository name as well as the rounded number of forks and stars. Built with Material UI.

## Usage

Users should type a repository name they're looking for into the search field. The results will be rendered in a table-like view 6 items at a time. If there are more than 6 results returned by the API, the pagination block is shown towards the bottom giving users ability to navigate to further and previous pages.

Each item in the table is a link to the repository it holds :)
